# Interface: ExpressRequestLike

Defined in: [server/middleware/express.ts:23](https://github.com/mbates/squareup/blob/main/src/server/middleware/express.ts#L23)

Minimal structural stand-ins for the Express types this middleware touches.

Express is only a peer/dev dependency, so it is deliberately kept out of the
published type graph. Importing `Request`/`Response`/`RequestHandler` from
`express` here would make the generated declaration file reach back into
untranspiled TypeScript source in the JSR npm tarball, breaking every
`/server` consumer — including ones that never touch Express (see
[#128](https://github.com/mbates/squareup/issues/128)). The sibling Next.js
and Lambda middleware already declare their own local types for the same
reason. These interfaces are structurally compatible with Express 4 and 5, so
`createExpressWebhookHandler(...)` still drops straight into
`app.post(path, handler)` with full type-checking.
