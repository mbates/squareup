# Type Alias: WebhookSubscription

> **WebhookSubscription** = `Omit`\<`Square.WebhookSubscription`, `"signatureKey"`\>

Defined in: [core/services/webhook-subscriptions.service.ts:13](https://github.com/mbates/squareup/blob/main/src/core/services/webhook-subscriptions.service.ts#L13)

A webhook subscription as returned by `get`, `list`, and `update`.

Note the absence of `signatureKey`: Square only returns the signature key
**once, on creation**. Persist it then — see [CreatedWebhookSubscription](CreatedWebhookSubscription.md).
A later `get`/`list` never includes it; to recover a usable key without
losing the subscription, rotate it with [WebhookSubscriptionsService.rotateSignatureKey](../classes/WebhookSubscriptionsService.md#rotatesignaturekey).
